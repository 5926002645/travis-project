<h1>Travis Scott: Early Life</h1>
<p>Travis Scott, born Jacques Webster II, was raised in Houston, Texas. His father was a soul musician, and his mother was a worker at a business office, exposing Travis to different types of music and environments at an early age. Growing up in Houston’s suburban area, Travis spent his early years listening to artists like Michael Jackson and Kanye West, which had a huge influence on his sound and future career.</p>
<p>Travis attended Elkins High School and then went on to study at the University of Texas at San Antonio. However, his passion for music led him to drop out and focus entirely on pursuing a career in hip-hop. He moved to New York City and started to build a name for himself in the music scene, before eventually signing with Epic Records and beginning his rise to fame.</p>

<p>Even in his early years, Scott showed immense ambition and a deep love for music. He would often experiment with beats and rapping, even before realizing he could make a career out of it. This early passion eventually led him to leave college and take a bold step into the music industry.</p>

<p>By the time he was a teenager, Travis was already experimenting with his music in his free time, paving the way for his future as an innovative force in the world of hip-hop.</p>
