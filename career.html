        <h1>Travis Scott: Career as a Rapper</h1>
        <p>Travis Scott’s career as a rapper skyrocketed after he signed with Kanye West’s GOOD Music as a producer, before eventually signing to Epic Records in 2012.

        <p>In 2013, Travis released his first mixtape, *Owl Pharaoh*, which was met with critical acclaim. His second mixtape, *Days Before Rodeo*, further solidified his status in the hip-hop community, featuring tracks like "Mamacita" and "Drugs You Should Try It". But it was his debut studio album, *Rodeo*, released in 2015, that truly cemented his position as one of the top rappers in the world.</p>

        <p>Rodeo featured hit singles like "Antidote" and collaborations with artists such as Kanye West, Justin Bieber, and Young Thug. His music blends elements of hip-hop, trap, and psychedelic sounds, which became a signature style. Over the years, his albums such as *Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight* (2016), *Astroworld* (2018), and *Utopia* (TBA) have consistently broken records, dominated charts, and earned him multiple Grammy nominations.</p>
